We utilize the CockroachDB model, please refer to this link below:

https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

(I feel this is more appropriate than copying the text verbatim.)

However, I do not think GCC, protoc, and pkgconfig are required.

Exceptions to this model will be reflected in this page as time goes on.
