This program distributes images to photosrv storage nodes. You should create a
list of filesystem paths representing a list of URLs.

The requests for the URLs can be sent via a dedicated outbound proxy.  This
proxy can be changed with the -proxy flag.

To run (in a screen or tmux session):

http_proxy= GOMAXPROCS=8 ./shardsprites -c /etc/photosrv.cfg -w 8 -dc yourDc -f urls.txt > retry-yourDc.txt

Failed URLs will be printed to stdout so they can be retried.  shardsprites
will connect to the storage machines via the web-proxy in the environment,
which is why we clear it before running.

Progress and ETA is printed to stderr.

I've played with the number of concurrent workers, and determined that more
than 8 only hurts the proxy and increases the failure rate and doesn't offer
any speed-up for the transfer.
